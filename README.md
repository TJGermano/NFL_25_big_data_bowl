# Motion Classification
# 2025 NFL Big Data Bowl 
## Introduction
This repository contains the scripts and analysis for my NFL motion analysis project. The goal is to take a different look at pre-snap motion in the NFL. By categorizing and analyzing motion types, we can uncover trends that connect pre-snap motion to post-snap outcomes. This analysis provides a simple, data-driven method to evaluate pre-snap motion and its role in modern football strategies.

## Data
The raw data used in this project is sourced from the Kaggle NFL Big Data Bowl. Below is the link to the dataset:
